		<h1>Hwb Y Gors Community Mosaic Mural</h1>
		<p>I’d like to invite you to be part of something special for the community of Cwmgors and surrounding area!</p>
<p>During a series of creative workshops, we’ll come together to explore ideas and co-design a vibrant community mosaic mural for the newly opened Hwb y Gors. This is a wonderful opportunity to connect and create something meaningful as a community.</p>
<p>The mural will be inspired by life in 1912—the year the original building was opened as the school. Together, we’ll delve into the everyday lives, memories, and local history from that time to shape a design that truly reflects the spirit of the area.</p>
<p>If you have any old photographs, stories, maps or anything else that can help us imagine what life was like in 1912, your contribution will play a valuable role in inspiring the design of our mural. </p>

		<p><strong>Ideas & Design Workshops – You're warmly welcome to come to any or all!</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Saturday 20th September 1pm – 3.45pm</li>
			<li>Thursday 25th September 11.30am - 2.45pm</li>
			<li>Saturday 27th September 1.30pm - 4.30pm</li>
			<li>Wednesday 1st October 11.30am - 2.45pm</li>
