		<h1>Hwb y Gors Community Mural</h1>
		<p>A vibrant new mosaic mural will soon brighten a wall at Hwb y Gors in Cwmgors, as we come together to celebrate the stories, history, and heart of the valley.</p>

		<p>The story so far... During a series of design workshops in September, the community came together to create a fantastic mural design inspired by 1912, the year the building first opened as a school.The design features much-loved local historical landmarks such as the Woollen Mill, Cresci’s Ice Cream Shop, Cwmgors Colliery and Brickworks and other glimpses of life from that era. Now it’s time to bring this incredible design to life — and you can be part of it!</p>
