			<h2>Amman Valley Mural</h2>
			<img src="img/portfolio/main-images/amman-valley-mural.avif" alt="Amman Valley Mural" class="full top">
			<p>This mural was designed, crafted and installed by a huge amount of amazing individuals who live in and love the Amman valley. To create the design Dani asked the question “What matters to you here?” Through shared stories and sketched scenes we explored the themes that define life in Cwmaman. A collective mural vision emerged - one that celebrates the history, identity, and the spirit of the valley.</p>

			<h2>Mosaic Street Mural</h2>
			<img src="img/portfolio/main-images/mosaic-street-mural.avif" alt="Mosaic Street Mural" class="full top">
			<p>The mural was designed and created by many people in the community of Ammanford. The children from Ysgol Bro Banw made some ceramic pieces - the words, the coal and lots of caterpillars. These were then incorporated into the mosaic which was created on mesh in a nearby hall. The community then got involved in installing the artwork on the street.</p>

It was great fun, and whether she knows it or not, in doing that cob mural with us, Dani gave us each a gift of some self-esteem, as well as some creative muddy good fun.”</p>
