With a drum roll provided by our local drummers, the red ribbon was cut by our oldest and youngest contributors, Jan Slade and James Brook, symbolically representing everyone who took part. As the veil dropped, it revealed a breathtaking mosaic—a vibrant reflection of the community that created it. Thank you to all those who came out to celebrate with us.</p> <p>This isn’t just any public artwork; it was a shared creation. Designed, crafted and installed by a huge amount of amazing individuals who live in, and love this place. We were all taught and guided by an incredible community artist, Dani Lee.</p> <h3>The Story Behind the Tiles</h3> <p>The journey began almost exactly a year ago, with the first Ideas and Design Workshop, where Dani asked us the question “What matters to us here”?</p> <p>From that point, ideas began to flow. In brainstorming sessions, residents shared stories, sketched scenes, and explored the themes that define life in Cwmaman. A word workshop added further inspiration, and over time, a collective vision emerged—one that celebrated the history, identity, and spirit of the valley.</p> <p>Once the final design was complete, the hands-on mosaic work began. The community of Cwmaman and friends created the mosaic in sections on flexible mesh at Bro Ryan Hall in Glanaman. It has been a labour of love, with hundreds of hours, countless cups of tea, and a great deal of laughter, patience, and dedication.</p> <p>When the last tile was set, the team moved on to the wall to install the mosaic in it’s final position. Every step—from prepping and grouting to cleaning and those all important finishing touches—were carried out with care and pride, even the organisation of “The Big Reveal” itself was a community effort.</p> <h3>A Mural Full of Meaning</h3> <p>The finished mural is more than just beautiful, it’s rich with meaning. It tells a story, shaped by the people who live here, and every detail was chosen by the community.</p> <p>Look closely and you’ll see the majestic mountains of Tair Carn Isaf rising in the background. We included some Welsh myth and legend by incorporating a beautiful dragon in our hills, as she gently breathes she creates the morning mist. Within that mist are figures, cyclists and horse riders along the riverside path. You’ll find a proud tribute to Yr Aman Rugby Club, their voices reaching skyward in song. There’s Hen Bethel chapel and its candlelit plygain tradition, echoing centuries of local heritage.</p> <p>Welcoming terraced houses glow with light and love, with the word “hiraeth” above. The river winds through the scene, alive with wildlife, from local wildflowers to the dippers and otters, even a red kite flying high. At the foundation we have our industrial history, represented in the pick axe, Raven Colliery and the minors helmet that still shines its light across our valley. </p> <p>For the young (and young at heart), there’s even a hidden challenge: can you spot all twelve little fish hidden in the river?</p> <p>For more photos see <a href="portfolio1.html">Portfolio</a></p> <h3>A Legacy for the Future</h3> <p>This mural is more than just a beautiful piece of art. It’s a reflection of who we are. It tells a story—our story—crafted by the hands of the people who live and love this place. It’s something we can all be proud of, and it will stand here for years to come, a colourful and lasting symbol of what we can achieve together.</p> <p>A massive thank you to every person who helped bring the mural to life. We hope it brings joy, pride, and inspiration to all who pass by.</p> <p>Please go take a look for yourself! The mural can be found on the wall to the right as you enter the car park to Cwmaman Community Centre in Glanaman. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYve8xPL8XAPW7nB9">Map</a></p> <p>If you're curious about how this extraordinary mural came to life, you’re in luck. The Carmarthen Archives (behind Carmarthen Library) and The Amman Valley Town Council holds an archive of design sketches, community contributions, and a slide show capturing the process—from first ideas to the final tile. </p> <p>This project was made possible thanks to the generous support of Shadows Depression Support Group, The National Lottery Community Fund, LBS, Carmarthenshire County Council and Ardex.</p> </div> <div class="news-item"> <div class="news-item-header"> <h2 class="news-item-title">Cwmaman Community Mural</h2> <time datetime="2024-05-26">26th May 2024</time> </div> <p>We are excited to announce that the creation of a mosaic mural, designed and made by you, the community of Glanaman, is due to begin this June!</p> <img src="img/booking/ammanford-wall.avif" alt="Wall" class="fr"> <p>This project will bring the community together in fun, friendly and free workshops to design and make a mural for this brick wall.

The event was a huge success with live music, hot drinks and delicious cakes. We are proud and grateful that the mural project was so well supported within our community. This enabled the whole celebration event to be put together from donations from local businesses and individuals.</p> <figure class="fr enclose"> <picture> <source type="image/avif" srcset="img/news/nov2021a.avif"> <img src="img/news/nov2021a.jpg" width="300" height="168" alt="The finished mural"> </picture> <figcaption>The finished mural and community notice board</figcaption> </figure> <p>Dani started the project with Ideas Workshops where members of the community collated thoughts on what images could be included in the mural. These were followed by Design Workshops where we all had the opportunity to translate our ideas into the mural design for Llandeilo.</p> <p>The actual hands on making of the mosaic began in early July and took 16 fun and creative day-long workshops held at The Hangout café throughout the summer.</p> <p>The theme for the mosaic was a question: Post lock down, what is important to us as a community and what do we value in our lives? This question was answered through the images we chose to include in the mosaic. The mosaic features lots of people holding hands representing our wish to be together, to do things together and build our community. The new provisions market symbolises Llandeilo supporting its people. Also there are lots of themes connected to nature - the geese, heron, flowers, mushrooms, fish and river. These symbolise the importance to those in the design workshops to portray a connection to nature and their wishes to not only preserve it but restore it, hence the leaping salmon in the Tywi! The rising sun over the mountains to the east gives a feeling of new beginnings and possibilities. There are also some Welsh and English words hidden in the mosaic. See if you can find all 5 of them.</p> <figure class="fl enclose"> <picture> <source type="image/avif" srcset="img/news/nov2021b.avif"> <img src="img/news/nov2021b.jpg" width="300" height="295" alt="Working on the mural"> </picture> <figcaption>Working on the mural with Jenny and Louise</figcaption> </figure> <p>In total, over the last 7 months, 88 adults and children from our community have been involved in the creation of the mosaic and we calculated that between everybody who participated we have given roughly 1,200 hours of our time (this excludes all the time Dani put in), so it really has been a labour of love!</p> <p>Community Artist, Dani Lee, making the mosaic with Jenny Thomas and Louise Bourns</p> <p>Finally at the end of October, the mosaic was finished and ready to be installed on the wall. At the Celebration event the red ribbon was cut to unveil the mural and noticeboard. It was cut by two of the workshop participants, Jan Salmon and Neil Matthew on behalf of the 88 individuals that made the mosaic! From the crowd there were exclaims of Ooooh and Wow! This was quite an emotional moment for everyone involved.</p> <p>The purpose of the noticeboard is to let people know about local events. There is lots of this information online and on facebook. However this information sometimes does not reach our elders who may not use this technology and the growing number of people who choose to not use social media. And sometimes people just like a good old notice board! So, this is a non-digital space for local community communication. We hope people will both enjoy and use it to share information about local events. Please bring along your posters to let everyone know what a vibrant town and strong community we have here in Llandeilo.</p> <figure class="fr enclose"> <picture> <source type="image/avif" srcset="img/news/nov2021c.avif"> <img src="img/news/nov2021c.jpg" width="300" height="204" alt="The finished mural"> </picture> <figcaption>The finished mural and community notice board</figcaption> </figure> <p>To take care of it all a few of us have formed a Stewardship group. This group will remove out-of-date messages and will ensure that the mural and the noticeboard are given a good clean every year.</p> <p>Some of the 88 people from Llandeilo that made the mural, at the celebration and proud of their work!</p> <p>We would like to express our gratitude to this project for bringing so many people together, particularly important in these times when many are isolated. We are also grateful to the many local businesses who supported the project. The list is too long to mention everyone but it includes everything from providing a space to hold the workshops, to creating the ceramic plaque next to the mosaic, to making yummy cakes for the celebration. We are very lucky to have so many kind people living in and around Llandeilo!</p> <p>Also, immense gratitude and recognition to all the community members who generously gave their time and creativity to the work. And perhaps the biggest ‘thank you’ must go to Dani, without whom this mural would never have seen the light of day.

This is a project to create a mosaic mural and community noticeboard, all designed and made by the people of Llandeilo!</p> <p><strong>The story so far&hellip;</strong><br>The idea started way back in 2019 as I lingered in front of noticeboards in shop doorways starting conversations with people who live and work in Llandeilo.</p> <p>So much was happening then in Llandeilo and the notice boards we have were jam packed and overcrowded! From these chats I discovered that many people want more connection and communication with their community but not all on-line. They want to find out local information by word of mouth or via a notice board rather than always from facebook or other on-line platforms.</p> <p>Together we also recognised that these boards of community communication were not in the most convenient of locations. Whilst reading the notices one needs to keep stepping out of the doorway to allow shoppers in and out of the shops. So, from these conversations, the idea germinated of a big central community notice board!</p> <p>Around this time the sixth formers of Ysgol Bro Dinefwr created a fantastic mural on the wall of the tennis pavilion by the playground. This received much positive feedback and praise from local residents and so generated enthusiasm for another community mural.</p> <p>It was these two elements that combined and inspired this project.</p> <p>At a consultation event in December ’19 it was decided that the mural and noticeboard would be located on the side wall of Hugh Evans and Son Butchers, in the walkway connecting the main car park to Rhosmaen Street.</p> <img src="img/news/aug20.jpg" alt="Before photo of wall in Llandeilo" class="fr"> <p>This is already a place where people meet and chat away from the busy high street traffic, so it’s an ideal area for interaction with the noticeboard. And we already have a small but growing team of people offering to maintain the notice board once it’s up and running. The surrounding mural will add a visually and texturally exciting focal point and draw attention to the notice board.</p> <p>I have been working with Transition Tywi Trawsnewid to raise the funds necessary. The project has now received funding from The National Lottery Community Fund. We are also being supported by LBS and DL Williams and have received kind donations from local residents.</p> <p>Over the coming months we will be holding creative community workshops. These will be open to all. During these workshops we will first design the mural. Then we will begin to create the mosaic. Once complete the mosaic will then be installed on the wall in the walkway.</p> <p>In addition to the ever-expanding list of local people and groups already wanting to be involved in the project we will be publicising bilingually via posters on the very visible mural site wall and on the existing notice boards in Llandeilo. Also look out for what’s happening in The Post community magazine and watch this space for the latest News.</p> </div> </main> <footer class="footer"> <div class="footer-nav-wrap"> <ul class="footer-nav nav"> <li><a href="./">Home</a></li> <li><a href="portfolio1.html">Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li> <li><a href="news.html">News</a></li> <li><a href="booking.html">Booking</a></li> </ul> <div class="footer-links"> <div> <a href="tel:07971286442">07971 286442</a> </div> <div> <a href="mailto:dani@danileearts.co.uk">dani@danileearts.co.uk</a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="copy">&copy;2020 Dani Lee Arts, Wernlas, Cwmdu, Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, SA19 7EE.</div> <div class="credit"><a href="https://pontbren.com">Website by Pontbren</a></div> </footer> <script src="js/scripts-1757348508478.min.js"></script> </body> </html>
